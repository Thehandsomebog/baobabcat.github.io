            <h2>What Is OpenClaw?</h2>
            <p>OpenClaw is an open-source AI assistant platform that lets you deploy intelligent chatbots and virtual assistants across every channel your business uses. Unlike closed-source alternatives that lock you into a single vendor, OpenClaw gives you complete control over your data, your integrations, and your customer experience.</p>
            <p>With OpenClaw, your AI assistant can operate simultaneously on WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, web chat, and SMS, providing consistent, accurate responses trained on your own knowledge base. It connects to over 50 services out of the box, from CRMs and helpdesks to scheduling tools and payment processors, so your assistant can do more than just answer questions.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, OpenClaw offers full data sovereignty. Your business data stays yours, whether you deploy on-premises or in your own cloud environment. No third-party vendor has access to your conversations, customer data, or proprietary knowledge.</p>
