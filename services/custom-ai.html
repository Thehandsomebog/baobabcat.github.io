                <h2>What It Is</h2>
                <p>Custom AI Solutions is our end-to-end service for designing and building bespoke AI applications that address the specific problems your business faces. Rather than forcing off-the-shelf tools into your workflow, we engineer purpose-built systems -- from document intelligence engines and predictive models to computer vision pipelines and natural language interfaces -- that integrate seamlessly with your existing infrastructure.</p>
                <p>Every business operates differently. The data you collect, the decisions you need to make, and the outcomes you optimize for are unique to your organization. Generic AI products can only take you so far. A custom solution, built around your data and your processes, delivers significantly higher accuracy, adoption, and ROI because it is designed to work the way your team already works.</p>
                <p>Our team handles every phase of development -- from scoping and data preparation through model training, testing, and deployment -- so you get a production-ready system without needing to hire an in-house machine learning team. We also provide ongoing support and iteration so your AI continues to improve as your business evolves.</p>

                        <summary>How long does it take to build a custom AI solution?</summary>
                        <p>Timelines vary based on complexity. A focused proof-of-concept can be delivered in 4-6 weeks, while a full production system typically takes 3-6 months. During the Discovery phase, we provide a detailed project plan with milestones so you always know what to expect.</p>

                        <summary>Do I need a large dataset to get started?</summary>
                        <p>Not necessarily. While more data generally leads to better results, we can work with smaller datasets by leveraging transfer learning, synthetic data augmentation, and pre-trained foundation models. During the Data Assessment phase, we will evaluate what you have and recommend the best path forward.</p>
